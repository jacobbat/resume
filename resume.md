# Summary

I am a cloud engineering consultant with experience leading the delivery of a wide range of cloud automation solutions for clients spanning from small engineering shops to the most valuable companies in the world. I really enjoy most of the work that goes into delivering a successful project. I also take pride in my work and thrive on creating automation systems that are well engineered, reusable and elegant. Having the privilege to be a part of many high performing engineering organizations has taught me to be humble and to adapt to any team dynamic. My mission is to elevate any team that I'm a part of and to bring value to an organization through technology, collaboration, and a mind set of continuous learning and improving.
